JSDrawingParticles
==================

Particle system created with JavaScript. This is free for anyone to build upon or use in anyway they please.

I originally created this to polish up an assignment. I stripped all the parts of it that resembled the assignment(so that only the particle engine was left), modified it to made it easier for someone else to use, and then commented it to better explain each portion of it.
